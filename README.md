## Description 

Hello! This is a node project that utilitizes the mysql2, inquirer, and console.table packages. This project was created to complete my week 12 U of MN Web Dev bootcamp assignment. Via the command line, a user can manipulate data in a sql database, thus this serves the purpose of a basic content management system. Schema and Seed SQL files should be run before invoking the application so that the user can have initial data in the database. Thank you!
